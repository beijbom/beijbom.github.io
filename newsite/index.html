<p>I'm a Ph.D candidate at the <a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu">Computer Vision group</a> at the <a href="http://cs.ucsd.edu">UCSD computer science department</a>. My research focuses on the automated annotation and analysis of scientific data. Specifically, I focus on the automated annotation of coral reef survey images, within the scope of a National Science Foundation project: Computer Vision Coral Ecology. </p>

<p>Before joining UCSD I was lead developer at <a href="http://hovding.com">Hövding</a>, a Swedish startup company. As their first employee and engineer I created the algorithmic framework and hardware design for Hövding's renowned <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/15/invisible-bike-helmet/">invisible bicycle helmet</a>.</p>
 
 <p> I received my joint B.S / M.S degree in Engineering Physics from <a href="http://www.lth.se/english/">Lund University</a> in 2007. My masters thesis work at <a href="http://cellavision.com">Cellavision</a> on <a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/sites/default/files/Single%20image%20focus%20level%20assessment%20using%20SVM_1.pdf">Single Image Focus Level Assessment Using Support Vector Machines</a> received several awards and generated an international patent.</p></p>
