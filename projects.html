            Always focused on making sure my work is useful in practice, I started developing the CoralNet website in 2011 together with some talented undergraduate students at UCSD. CoralNet is a repository and a resource for benthic images analysis. The site implements our <a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/sites/default/files/automated_coral_annotation.pdf">method</a> from CVPR2012 and allow researchers, agencies, and private partners to rapidly annotate benthic survey images. The site also serves as a repository and collaboration platform for the scientific community. [<a href="http://coralnet.ucsd.edu">www</a>]
           </p>
           <p> CoralNet users include the <a href="http://www.catlinseaviewsurvey.com/">Caitlin Seaview Survey</a>. This ambitions program aims at doing the first world-wide coral reef survey, and we are very excited to have them as our partner. Other users include Colby Colleage and, recently, student groups from Stanford. </p>

         The Moorea Labeled Corals dataset is a subset of the Moorea Coral Reef-Long Term Ecological Research (<a href="http://mcr.lternet.edu/">MCR-LTER</a>) dataset, packaged for Computer Vision research. It contains over 400.000 expert annotations across 2055 coral reef survey images from the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. Each image has 200 expert random point annotations, indicating the substrate underneath each point. The dataset is unique in the computer vision litterature becuase it was collected, not for computer vision researcheres, but for coral ecology. As such it provides a unique oportunity for method benchmark and evaluation.

            From Hövding's website: Hövding is a bicycle helmet unlike any other currently on the market. It's ergonomic, it's practical, it complies with all the safety requirements, and it's also subtle and blends in with what else you are wearing.Hövding is a collar for bicyclists, worn around the neck. The collar contains a folded up airbag that you'll only see if you happen to have an accident. The airbag is shaped like a hood, surrounding and protecting the bicyclist's head. The trigger mechanism is controlled by sensors which pick up the abnormal movements of a bicyclist in an accident. The actual collar is the visible part of the invention. It's covered by a removable shell that you can change to match your outfit, and we'll be launching new designs all the time. Hövding is a practical accessory that's easy to carry around, it's got a great-looking yet subtle design, and it will save your life. </p>

            <p> I was fortunate to be the first employee at Hövding. My task was to develop the accident detection system from scratch. This involved everything from selecting hardware sensors, collecting train data, setting up a computational infrastructure, defining target performances, and developing the actual algorithm. I worked with a small team of engineers on this task. </p>

            <p> There are tons of cool images and vides on Hövding's homepage </p>

            From Cellavisions website: CellaVision AB develops and markets products for the health care sector, enabling fast and firm blood cell analysis and quality assurance of morphology diagnosis.
            The company has cutting-edge expertise within sophisticated digital image analysis, artificial intelligence and automated microscopy. For laboratories, this means increased efficiency, a simplification of the procedures and confirmed proficiency.
           The product line includes systems for automatic blood cell differentials and software for differential proficiency testing and education. The products are sold to hospital laboratories and independent commercial laboratories. Today CellaVision is represented in Europe, North America and to some extent in Asia. 
           </p>

           <p> I did my masters thesis at Cellavision, where I worked on a single-image focus level assessment method for blood cell images. This is in contrast with standard methods for image focusing that use multiple images together to determine focus level. The method I developed has an international patent and is used today at Cellavision. <a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/sites/default/files/Single%20image%20focus%20level%20assessment%20using%20SVM_1.pdf">[www]</a> </p>
